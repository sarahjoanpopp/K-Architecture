                <h1>At the intersection of utopia and pragmatism we create contemporary architecture that feeds the imagination with an afro-futurist vision.</h1>
                <p>Informed by tradition, our practice explores new modes of construction for which the foundations have long been laid. Innovative uses of local resources and participatory design methods allow us to work beyond the boundaries of most established design practices and shed dominant norms to set our own precedents. Working across diverse geographies, our portfolio spans a wide spectrum of projects from civic infrastructure to temporary installations, from concept to execution. Founded by Francis Kéré in 2005, with a dual focus on design and social commitment, the studio's scope encompasses building, design and knowledge sharing.</p>

                <h2>Our Expertise</h2>
                <p>Working beyond the realm of most established contemporary architecture practices, we have gathered expert knowledge in a number of areas through our diverse portfolio of projects.</p>
                <p>Our approach is local and participatory, learning from and responding to each project’s context and placing a project’s users at the centre of the design process, in order to ask the right questions. It then draws from our legacy of creativity and resourcefulness to respond with sustainable solutions that project an afrofuturistic vision, casting off dominant norms to set our own precedents.</p>
                <p>Over time our work has become renowned for defining design characteristics that have emerged from this holistic approach. Favouring local and environmentally sustainable resources, we have explored new ways of transforming materials, gaining particular experience with the use of clay. The concern for thermal comfort stems from a careful study of local knowledge, resulting in the honing of various innovative roof elements.</p>
                <p>We believe the solutions the present moment calls for need to be informed by tradition to develop practices suitable for the reality of our time, building something that never was, but for which the foundations have long been laid. </p>

                <h2>Sustainability</h2>
                <p>Today the notion of sustainability has lost much of its meaning as a result of disingenuous and narrow interpretations. Kéré Architecture understands its sustainable design approach as one that embraces a complexity of choices, a pragmatic approach that can imply informed compromises.</p>
                <p>Our projects aim to encompass not only the ecological but also the social and economic aspects of sustainability. This means taking into consideration the many consequences of each design decision, both during construction and throughout the lifespan of a completed project.</p>
                <p>Avoiding the need for air-conditioning through passive cooling strategies is ecologically sound while also lowering the running costs of a building. The sculptural brise-soleil facade of the National Assembly of Benin is a justifiable expense, as the shading it provides radically lowers direct sun exposure. The stripping down of eucalyptus poles for the Schorge Campus facades is a labour-intensive process, however the material is locally available, affordable and easily repairable.</p>
                <p>We consider it part of our mandate to address these decisions by weighing the sometimes conflicting benefits of different options.</p>
